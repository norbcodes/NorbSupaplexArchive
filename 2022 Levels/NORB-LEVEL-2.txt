4.2.2022 - Date of creation.

Despite it's name, it isn't my second level ;)
So... Welcome to the Zonk Storage Facility! Here's the backstory I wrote for it:
"The Zonk Storage Facility is a part of the Official Zonk Manufacturing facility, which is where the manufactured Zonks are stored befored they are shipped to level creators so they can use them in their levels.

Due to the snik-snak infestation in their facility, the manufacturing is paused until the snik-snaks are eradicated and the place is safe. Until then, no Zonks are manufactured so there is a world-wide shortage of Zonks."
